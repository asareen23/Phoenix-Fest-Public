scheduling process for \"unpopular\" sessions\n","    - First, identify a threshold in which the total of number of signs-ups *does not* yield a sufficient number of presentees in a session (this in its self will need to be a threshold but is rather arbitrary; for this year, ten seems like a good number). Assign this number to *t<sub>1</sub>*\n","        - Quick analysis indicates *t<sub>1</sub>* is likely around 25-35\n","    - Then, using *t<sub>1</sub>*, find all the sessions that do not meet this threshold **and** do not meet another threshold, *t<sub>2</sub>*, which is the total number of sign ups for a specific choice (i.e. first, second, third...)\n","        - Quick analysis here indicates that *t<sub>2</sub>* is like around 4-8\n","    - If a session meets *both* requirements, then assign them special privieliges in assigning; we can call this designation **FA** (force assign)\n","- For all FA sessions, take all the people who signed up for the session, regardless if it was their third, fourth, or fifth choice, and assign them to the session\n","    - To do this, we can introduce another parameter into `session_assign()` that checks if a session meets this special condition, and check for this special condition within `schedule()` \n","        - This should be sufficient, given that this only needs to happen once per block\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"6f9b6d5f13b34e4ca7c2aabf329ee621","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[]},"source":[]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":["<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=a723c23f-b8da-4d0b-84c5-26f14cea2568' target=\"_blank\">\n","<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz4KPHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iODBweCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MHB4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgODAgODAiIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxuczp4bGluaz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMTk5OS94bGluayI+CiAgICA8IS0tIEdlbmVyYXRvcjogU2tldGNoIDU0LjEgKDc2NDkwKSAtIGh0dHBzOi8vc2tldGNoYXBwLmNvbSAtLT4KICAgIDx0aXRsZT5Hcm91cCAzPC90aXRsZT4KICAgIDxkZXNjPkNyZWF0ZWQgd2l0aCBTa2V0Y2guPC9kZXNjPgogICAgPGcgaWQ9IkxhbmRpbmciIHN0cm9rZT0ibm9uZSIgc3Ryb2tlLXdpZHRoPSIxIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIiBmaWxsLXJ1bGU9ImV2ZW5vZGQiPgogICAgICAgIDxnIGlkPSJBcnRib2FyZCIgdHJhbnNmb3JtPSJ0cmFuc2xhdGUoLTEyMzUuMDAwMDAwLCAtNzkuMDAwMDAwKSI+CiAgICAgICAgICAgIDxnIGlkPSJHcm91cC0zIiB0cmFuc2Zvcm09InRyYW5zbGF0ZSgxMjM1LjAwMDAwMCwgNzkuMDAwMDAwKSI+CiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICA8cG9seWdvbiBpZD0iUGF0aC0yMCIgZmlsbD0iIzAyNjVCNCIgcG9pbnRzPSIyLjM3NjIzNzYyIDgwIDM4LjA0NzY2NjcgODAgNTcuODIxNzgyMiA3My44MDU3NTkyIDU3LjgyMTc4MjIgMzIuNzU5MjczOSAzOS4xNDAyMjc4IDMxLjY4MzE2ODMiPjwvcG9seWdvbj4KICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIDxwYXRoIGQ9Ik0zNS4wMDc3MTgsODAgQzQyLjkwNjIwMDcsNzYuNDU0OTM1OCA0Ny41NjQ5MTY3LDcxLjU0MjI2NzEgNDguOTgzODY2LDY1LjI2MTk5MzkgQzUxLjExMjI4OTksNTUuODQxNTg0MiA0MS42NzcxNzk1LDQ5LjIxMjIyODQgMjUuNjIzOTg0Niw0OS4yMTIyMjg0IEMyNS40ODQ5Mjg5LDQ5LjEyNjg0NDggMjkuODI2MTI5Niw0My4yODM4MjQ4IDM4LjY0NzU4NjksMzEuNjgzMTY4MyBMNzIuODcxMjg3MSwzMi41NTQ0MjUgTDY1LjI4MDk3Myw2Ny42NzYzNDIxIEw1MS4xMTIyODk5LDc3LjM3NjE0NCBMMzUuMDA3NzE4LDgwIFoiIGlkPSJQYXRoLTIyIiBmaWxsPSIjMDAyODY4Ij48L3BhdGg+CiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICA8cGF0aCBkPSJNMCwzNy43MzA0NDA1IEwyNy4xMTQ1MzcsMC4yNTcxMTE0MzYgQzYyLjM3MTUxMjMsLTEuOTkwNzE3MDEgODAsMTAuNTAwMzkyNyA4MCwzNy43MzA0NDA1IEM4MCw2NC45NjA0ODgyIDY0Ljc3NjUwMzgsNzkuMDUwMzQxNCAzNC4zMjk1MTEzLDgwIEM0Ny4wNTUzNDg5LDc3LjU2NzA4MDggNTMuNDE4MjY3Nyw3MC4zMTM2MTAzIDUzLjQxODI2NzcsNTguMjM5NTg4NSBDNTMuNDE4MjY3Nyw0MC4xMjg1NTU3IDM2LjMwMzk1NDQsMzcuNzMwNDQwNSAyNS4yMjc0MTcsMzcuNzMwNDQwNSBDMTcuODQzMDU4NiwzNy43MzA0NDA1IDkuNDMzOTE5NjYsMzcuNzMwNDQwNSAwLDM3LjczMDQ0MDUgWiIgaWQ9IlBhdGgtMTkiIGZpbGw9IiMzNzkzRUYiPjwvcGF0aD4KICAgICAgICAgICAgPC9nPgogICAgICAgIDwvZz4KICAgIDwvZz4KPC9zdmc+' > </img>\n","Created in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>"]}],"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"deepnote_execution_queue":[],"deepnote_notebook_id":"997b81aebd934936a54350a3951f2441","deepnote_persisted_session":{"createdAt":"2023-05-25T16:47:56.126Z"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
