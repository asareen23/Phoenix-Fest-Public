# This is where all exported files will be sent to. 

The files will be organized into two subdirectories:

- Docs
  - Houses the exported `.docx` files, including:
    - Individual Schedules for each student assigned during Phoenix Fest
    - The rosters for individual sessions that used to take attendance
  - CSVs
    - Individual Schedules for each student, housed in a CSV format where every row is a new student and every column is a piece of information about their schedule (their name, advisory, first block session, second block session, etc...)
    - Rosters, where each row is a new session and each column is a piece of information for that session (people attending the session, maximum cap, minimum cap, etc...)

It is likely while running the program you will need to delete this multople times to clear it or download it when you need to distribute the schedules.
